# Host

Hosts are applications which helps the citizens to generate and save securely their cryptographic keys.
They also simplify the processes of publishing a card, checking referendums, publishing endorsements, voting, checking results, etc.
Hosts should aim at a good reputation so that citizens are confident using them.
They may take the form of a webservice, a computer or smartphone app.
In the first case, the citizen should be very confident with the webservice because it will handle its private keys.
In the second case, the private key should not go out of the citizen's computer or phone.

To ensure the private information of the citizen is handled safely, host applications and webservice should be audited and endorsed by reputable organizations, including trusters.
Host applications and webservices should be fully open-source so that audits are easier to conduct.

**Note:** a host is not strictly necessary for a citizen to perform all the possible operations.
An expert in computer science can participate as a citizen without using any host.
Hosts are provided only to facilitate operations for citizens who are not computer science experts.
