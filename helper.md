# helper

Helpers are applications which helps the citizens to generate and host securely their cryptographic keys.
Moreover, they also simplifies the processes of registering a card, checking referendums, publishing an endorsement, voting, checking results, etc.
Helpers should aim at a good reputation so that citizens are confident using them.

Helpers may take the form of a webservice, a computer or smartphone app.
In the first case, the citizen should be very confident with the webservice because it will handle its private keys.
In the second case, the private key should not go out of the citizen's computer or phone.

To ensure the private information of the citizen is handled safely, applications and webservice should be audited and endorsed by reputable organizations, including trusters.
We recommend that helper applications and webservices are fully open-source so that audits are greatly facilitated.
