# Endorsement

## Description

Endorsements are published by citizens or trusters to endorse cards, referendums, stations and trusters.
If set, the `revoke` field means that any previous endorsement of the same participant should be disregarded.
A citizen can endorse her own card with a revoke field set to publicly discard it.
Then, she may create a new card with the same public key or a new public key.
The `endorsed.signature` field is necessary only when endorsing a card or a referendum.
It should not be set when endorsing a truster or a station.
Trusters publish endorsements based on their expertise and deep analysis of many publications, including endorsements.
Referendums and stations should not publish any endorsement.
Citizens and trusters can endorse any other participant.

As a citizen, you should mainly endorse other citizens by reviewing and signing electronically their card.
The review process is a questionnaire in which you will assess the accuracy of the information provided on the card.
If you answer yes to every question, you should endorse the card.
Question includes: "Do you know well the person?" or "Did you meet physically the person recently?".
Like cards, endorsements are published on the Internet so that everyone can see them.
