# directdemocracy.world

directdemocracy.world aims at establishing [direct democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy) everywhere.
Such a direct democracy will bring peace, safety and prosperity to humananity, including saving the climate and the biodiversity.
The principle is that people will become citizens by organizing referundums and voting regardless of any official acknowledgement.
Vote results from a limited number of citizens could be considered as survey results.
Such results could feed debates, influence political decisions and incitate more people to become citizens.
Vote results from areas where a majority of people are citizens will become significant from a democratic point of view.
This will increase the pressure on governments to respect the democratic choices expressed by their people.
Ultimately this bottom-up initiative will enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world.

This direct democracy is based on five essentials components:

1. citizens.
2. endorsements.
3. trust.
4. referendums.
5. votes.
