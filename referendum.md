# Referendum

## Description

A referendum is a [publication](publication.md) written by a citizen aiming at proposing a law at a specific political level: world, country, state, region, city, etc.
In case of a law conflict, the upper level law has always the priority over the lower level law.
For example, if a world law forbid the death penalty, then no lower level law (country, state, region, city, etc.) can allow it.
Once a referendum proposing a new law is accepted by a majority of voters, the corresponding law should be applied within the delay specified in the description of the referendum.
