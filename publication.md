# Publication

A publication is a JSON file that is published at one or several places on the Internet, including at [publishers](publisher.md).
It includes at least the public key of its author, the signature of its author and the publication date.
The JSON file is originally created without any signature field.
It is then signed and the signature field is added to the JSON file.
