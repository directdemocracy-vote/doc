# publication

A publication is a JSON file that is published at one or several places on the Internet.
It includes at least the public key of its author, the signature of its author and the publication date.
The file is originally created without any signature field.
It is then signed and the signature file is added to the file.
The signature is generated by computing the hash of the message without signature and encrypting this hash with the private key.
To verify the signature, one should remove the signature field from the message, compute the hash of the message, decrypt this hash using
the public key of the author and compare the result with the provided signature.
