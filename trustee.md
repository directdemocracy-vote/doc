# Trustee

Any individual or organization can become a trustee.
Trustees process publications and endorse publications and participants.
Trustees should establish a good reputation from others' endorsements.
Citizen will not take part in referendums which rely on trustees they don't trust.
So, trustees should develop the best trust algorithms to publish good endorsements and thus achieve a good reputation.
