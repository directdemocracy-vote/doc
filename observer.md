# observer

An observer is a website that helps the citizen to check the vote process and the final results for a specific referendum.
Before the referendum deadline is reached, it displays the participation in real time as well as every individual registration.
This allows citizens to check that their registration was actually published.
Once the referendum deadline has passed, it will display, in addition to the previous information, the vote results.
This includes the final participation, vote percentages for each answer, and possible irregularities.
Observers should have a good reputation to display correct and fairly well presented information.
However, the information they display is publicly available from other sources, so auditing them should be very easy.
