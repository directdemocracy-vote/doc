# publisher

A publisher is a website that hosts the publications of citizens, stations and trustees.
It makes this information available to any computer participant (citizens, stations and trustees) via a REST interface.
It also makes this information available to anyone in a nice, human readable, web pages, including figures, pictures, graphics and explanations.
Publishers should have a good reputation to display correct and fairly well presented information.
However, the information they display is publicly available from other sources, so auditing them should be very easy.
