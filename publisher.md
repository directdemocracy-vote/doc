A publisher is a website that hosts the publications of citizens, referendum authors, anonymizers and trusters.
It makes this information available to any computer participant (anonymizers and trusters) via a REST interface.
It also makes this information available to anyone in a nice, human readable, web pages, including figures, pictures, graphics and explanations.
Publishers should have a good reputation to display correct and fairly well presented information.
