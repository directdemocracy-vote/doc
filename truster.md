# Truster

Any individual or organization can become a truster.
Trusters process publications and endorse publications and participants.
Trusters should establish a good reputation from others' endorsements.
Citizen will not take part in referendums which rely on trusters they dont trust.
So, trusters should develop the best trust algorithms to publish good endorsements and thus achieve a good reputation.
